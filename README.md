## Nbackup
`Nbackup` is a tool that leverages `robocopy` to backup a list of files and folders from a source to a destination. It is designed to be reliable and efficient, ensuring that your data is safe.
- Nbackup command line options:
```
 Nbackup.exe [-i value] [-e value] [-v value] [-performbackup value]
  - i             : input json file which specifies source, destination and backup options. (string, default=)
  - e             : Extract input json example file to current directory. (string, default=)
  - v             : Verbose level (true or false, default=False)
  - performbackup :  Set to false to verify json file without backup (true or false, default=True)
```
## Nbuild
`Nbuild` (`Nb`) is a tool that launches MSBuild with a target to build.

- Nb.exe is a command line tool that installs the development tools and runtimes required to build and test the solution. It is a wrapper for MSBuild and provides a simplified interface for building solutions. It also provides a way to define and run custom targets.
  - To run a target type `Nb.exe [Target Name]`
  - The list of targets is generated by running `Nb.exe -c targets` command.

**Expects**:
- `nbuild.targets` file in the solution folder.
- `common.targets` file in `$(ProgramFiles)\Nbuild`.

More details on `nbuild.targets` and `common.targets` can be found at the end of this section.

**Generates**:
- `nbuild.bat` used to run MSBuild to build any target defined in `*.targets` files.
- [`targets.md`](./targets.md) which lists all the targets defined in `*.targets` files.

**Usage**:
```cmd
 Nb.exe [-c value] [-json value] [-v value]
  - c    : Specifies the command to execute. Possible values: targets, install, uninstall, download, list.
         targets         -> Lists available targets and saves them in the targets.md file.
         install         -> Downloads and installs apps specified in the -json option.
         uninstall       -> Uninstalls apps specified in the -json option.
         download        -> Downloads apps specified in the -json option.
         list            -> Lists apps specified in the -json option.
         ----
         - By default, the -json option points to the `NTools` deployment folder: $(ProgramFiles)\build\tools.json.
         - The install, uninstall, and download commands require admin privileges to run. (string, default=)
  - json : Specifies the JSON file that holds the list of apps. Only valid for the install, download, and list commands.
         Sample JSON file: https://github.com/naz-hage/`NTools`/blob/main/Nbuild/resources/app-`NTools`.json
          (string, default=$(ProgramFiles)\nbuild\`NTools`.json)
  - v    : Optional parameter which sets the console output verbose level
         ----
         - if no command line options are specified with the -v option , i.e.: 'Nb.exe staging -v true`
           `Nb` will run an MSbuild target `staging` defined in a `nbuild.targets` file which present in the solution folder.
           Run `Nb.exe -t Targets` to list the available targets.
         -v Possible Values: (true or false, default=False)
```


- **If the -json option is not specified, the default json file `$(ProgramFiles)\Nbuild\`NTools`.json` is used if it exists**. 

**Examples**:

Open a Terminal and navigate to your solution folder.

-   Build a solution:

    ```cmd
    Nb.exe solution
    ```
- Clean a solution:

    ```cmd
    Nb.exe clean
    ```

- Run tests on a solution:

    ```cmd
    Nb.exe test
    ```
- Create a staging build:

    ```cmd
    Nb.exe staging
    ```
- Display available options:
    
    ```cmd
    Nb.exe -c targets
    ```

### nbuild.targets
- `nbuild.targets` is a MSBuild file that imports `common.targets`.
- The following properties are required in `nbuild.targets`:
    - SolutionName: The name of the solution file.
    	```xml
        <PropertyGroup>
    		<!--The GUID should be replaced with the solution name-->
        	<SolutionName></SolutionName>
            <DeploymentFolder>$(ProgramFiles)\Nbuild</DeploymentFolder>
    	    </PropertyGroup>
        ```

- The following target is required in `nbuild.targets`:
    - ARTIFACTS: The folder where the artifacts are copied to.
        ```xml
        <Target Name="ARTIFACTS" DependsOnTargets="TAG">
        <!--The folder where the artifacts are copied to-->
        <ItemGroup>
            <BinaryFiles Include="$(Solut
        ```
                    
### common.targets
- `common.targets` is imported by `nbuild.targets`.

- Common TARGETS:

| Target Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PROPERTIES | Sets up properties for the build process, reads the Git tag, checks if essential properties are defined, and prints out some properties and git information. |
| CLEAN | Cleans the solution by removing the output directories and deleting the obj directories. |
| STAGING | Executes a series of targets for staging: CLEAN, TAG, AUTOTAG_STAGING, SOLUTION, TEST, SAVE_ARTIFACTS, PACKAGE. |
| STAGING_DEPLOY | Executes the STAGING target and then the DEPLOY target. |
| PRODUCTION | Executes a series of targets for production: CLEAN, TAG, |AUTOTAG_PRODUCTION, SOLUTION, TEST, SAVE_ARTIFACTS, PACKAGE. |
| PRODUCTION_DEPLOY | Executes the PRODUCTION target and then the DEPLOY target. |
| AUTOTAG_STAGING | Sets the build type to STAGING. |
| AUTOTAG_PRODUCTION | Sets the build type to PRODUCTION and updates the main branch of the git repository. |
| AUTOTAG_PRODUCTION | Increments version for a production build, but only if the current branch is 'main' || SIGN_PRODUCT | Placeholder target for signing the product. Currently, it does not perform any actions. |
| GIT_TAG | Commits changes to the git repository, pulls the latest changes, pushes the changes, and creates a tag. |
| AUTOTAG | Gets the git branch, reads the build type, and automatically creates a tag based on the branch and build type. |
| SOLUTION | Builds the solution using the `dotnet build` command with the specified configuration, version, and culture. |
| SOLUTION_MSBUILD | Restores the solution's dependencies with `dotnet restore` and then builds the solution using MSBuild with the specified configuration, platform, version, and culture. |
| PACKAGE | Creates a zip file of the artifacts folder and then removes the artifacts folder. |
| SAVE_ARTIFACTS | Copies various types of files (binary files, EnUSFiles, ref, RunTimesLib, Default, RunTimesLibNet, RunTimesNetStandard20, RunTimesNative) to the artifacts folder. |
| Deploy | Checks if the user is an administrator and if the DeploymentFolder property is defined. If both conditions are met, it extracts the zip file of the artifacts folder to the deployment folder and then removes the setup folder. |
| TEST | Runs tests on the solution with the `dotnet test` command with the specified configuration and logger settings. |
| TEST_RELEASE | Similar to TEST, but uses the release configuration. |
| SingleProject | Demonstrate how to build a single projec. Builds a specific project (`nbuild\nbuild.csproj`) using the `dotnet build` command with the specified configuration, runtime, version. |
| IS_ADMIN | Checks if the user is an administrator by running the `net session` command and sets the `IsAdmin` property based on the exit code. |
| GIT_STATUS | Displays the current git status |
| AUTOTAG_STAGING | Increments version for a staging build |
| SET_TAG | Sets version for a staging build |
| GIT_PULL | Pulls the latest changes from git |

| PUSH_TAG | Pushes the current tag to the remote repository |
| GIT_BRANCH | Gets the current branch from git |
| HandleError | Prints a high importance message stating that an error occurred while reading the version file. |


## Ngit
`Ngit` (`Ng`) is simple wrapper for `Git` tool that perform simple commands such as get tag and set tag.

**Usage**:
 ```batch
Ng.exe [-c value] [-url value] [-tag value] [-buildtype value] [-v value]
  - c         : git Command, value= [tag | settag| autotag| setautotag| deletetag | branch | clone]
     tag         -> Get the current tag
     autotag     -> Set next tag based on the build type: STAGING vs.PRODUCTION

  - buildtype : Build type used for -c autotag and -c setautotag Values: STAGING | PRODUCTION (string, default=)
  - v         : verbose. value = [true | false] (true or false, default=False)
 ```
## NbuildTasks
`NbuildTasks` is a class library that exposes `MSBuild` tasks. It is used by `Nbuild` to perform various tasks such as web download and tools installation during the build of any project.

NbuildTasks defines a few additional Tasks that can be used during builds. Here are a few examples:
```xml
<Target Name="TAG">
    <GetTag Branch="$(Branch)" BuildType="$(BuildType)">
        <Output TaskParameter="Tag" PropertyName="Tag" />
    </GetTag>
    <Message Text="Tag: $(Tag)" Importance="high" />
</Target>

<Target Name="REDERROR">
    <RedError Message="This is an error message displayed in Red" />
</Target>
```

You can find the complete list of predefined [MSBuild properties in the Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-reserved-and-well-known-properties?view=vs-2022).

## Additional Information
There are several predefined MSBuild properties that can be used during builds. Here are a few examples:
- `$(MSBuildProjectFile)`: The file name of the project file.
- `$(MSBuildProjectName)`: The file name of the project file without the extension.
- `$(MSBuildProjectExtension)`: The extension of the project file.
- `$(MSBuildProjectFullPath)`: The absolute path of the project file.
